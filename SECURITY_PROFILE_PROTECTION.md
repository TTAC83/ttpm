# Security Implementation for Profile Data Protection

## Issue Resolved: Customer Contact Information Security

The profiles table has been secured with comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies and secure access patterns to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive user information like phone numbers.

## Security Measures Implemented:

### 1. Enhanced RLS Policies
- **Anonymous Access Denial**: Explicit policy denying all access to unauthenticated users
- **Self-Access Only**: Users can only access their own full profile data including sensitive fields
- **Limited Project Member Access**: Project collaborators can only see essential fields (name, avatar, role) - phone numbers and job titles are excluded
- **Admin Override**: Internal admins retain full access for administrative purposes

### 2. Secure Access Functions
- **`get_safe_profile_info(uuid)`**: Secure database function that enforces field-level restrictions
- Returns only: user_id, name, avatar_url, role, is_internal
- Excludes sensitive data: phone, job_title, detailed personal information

### 3. Application-Level Security Utilities
- **`getSafeProfilesForProject()`**: Uses secure database function for project member access
- **`getCurrentUserProfile()`**: Full access only for user's own profile
- **`auditProfileAccess()`**: Security monitoring function

## How This Protects Against Data Theft:

1. **Field-Level Protection**: Sensitive fields like phone numbers are never exposed to other users
2. **Context-Based Access**: Profile data access is restricted based on project membership relationships
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only see the minimum information needed for collaboration
4. **Audit Logging**: Security events are tracked for monitoring

## Usage Guidelines:

### ✅ Secure Pattern (Use This):
```typescript
import { getSafeProfilesForProject } from '@/lib/secureProfileAccess';

// Get safe profile info for project collaboration
const profiles = await getSafeProfilesForProject(projectId);
// Returns only: name, avatar_url, role, is_internal
```

### ❌ Unsafe Pattern (Avoid):
```typescript
// DON'T: Direct profiles table access for other users
const { data } = await supabase.from('profiles').select('*');
// This would expose phone numbers and sensitive data
```

## Current Security Status:
- ✅ Phone numbers protected from unauthorized access
- ✅ Job titles and personal details restricted  
- ✅ Anonymous access completely blocked
- ✅ Secure functions enforce field-level controls
- ✅ Audit trail available for security monitoring
